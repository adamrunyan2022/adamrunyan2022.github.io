<h1>McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (1950)</h1>
<img src="https://www.okhistory.org/images/enc/2012.201.B0391.0687.jpg" alt="A picture of George W. McLaurin." style="width:300px;height:353px;">
<p class=header>Case Overview</p>
<p>The University of Oklahoma refused to allow George W. McLaurin (pictured above) attend the school. The schools' reasoning was a law that made it illegal for a school to teach both white and black students. A court struck down this law and permitted McLaurin to attend the school. However, heavy segregation was put in place to seperate him from the rest of the students.</p>
<p class=header>Constitutional Question</p>
<p>Since a lower court had already struck down the law barring McLaurin from attending the University of Oklahoma, this case needed to go higher up. This was four years before Brown v. Board of Education, and segregation was still common practice. The question was if segregating McLaurin from the other students restricted his privileges and violated the 14th amendment.</p>
<p class=header>Court Decision</p>
<p>The court's decision was unaminous, deciding that the school's actions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment.</p>
<p class=header>Significance</p>
<p>McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education was an incredibly important case, especially taking place just four years before Brown v. Board of Education. Brown v. Board made segregation in schools illegal, however McLaurin v. Oklahoma made mandated segregation illegal and was a huge step towards making all segregation in schools illegal.</p>
